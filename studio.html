          Honored with the <strong>AIA National Firm Award</strong> in 2015,
          Ehrlich Yanai Rhee Chaney Architects is a versatile practice that has
          earned an international reputation for design excellence and an
          exemplary professional culture. Founded in 1979, the Los Angeles and
          San Francisco-based firm is a 40 member team that has mastered
          building types ranging in scale from houses to courthouses, including
          libraries, university centers, corporate and government facilities.
          EYRC Architects has been recognized with more than 200 awards
          including twelve national AIA awards, and the title of AIA California
          Council Firm of the Year in 2003.
        </p>
        <p>
          Led by Partners Steven Ehrlich, FAIA; Takashi Yanai, FAIA; Patricia
          Rhee, FAIA; Mathew Chaney, AIA, Ashley Richardson, AIA, Bryn Garrett,
          AIA; and supported by eleven Principals and Associates, EYRC
          Architects’ design philosophy starts with a profound respect for a
          building’s inhabitants. This humanistic approach, referred to as
          Multicultural Modernism, has permeated the firm’s culture since the
          beginning, informing every creation and every interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seeds of this philosophy were planted during founder Steven
          Ehrlich’s six-year work/travel sojourn in Africa in the 1970s. Serving
          in the Peace Corps in Morocco, traversing the Sahara and later
          teaching architecture in Northern Nigeria, he studied vernacular
          “architecture without architects,” formed by the constraints of site
          and climate and the inspiration of culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ambition to create a healthy community culture spills over into
          the firm’s physical space, a repurposed 1917 dance hall located in
          Culver City, California. The entire staff sits in a single open-plan
          studio space and meetings and interactions regularly spill into the
          kitchen and onto the outside patio. A fierce work ethic prevails, but
          one that supports employees to challenge norms, be creative, and help
          maintain a live-work balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          A total of ten monographs have been published on the work of Ehrlich
          Architects including the latest, “Ehrlich Yanai Outside-In: New
          California Modernism,” published in April, 2019.
